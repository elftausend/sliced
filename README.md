# sliced

`sliced` provides basic array operations with automatic differentiation support implemented using [custos].<br>
This library can be used for an own tensor library and is basically a 'more open' [custos-math]. <br>
(WIP)

`sliced` optionally adds a `Matrix` wrapper to use the operations more effectively. <br>
